# MKS22X-BlobDetect
Final Project, June 2019 APCS

June 20th: Established video capabilities on my MacBook and discovered bounds of sizing the video
June 21st: Discovered PImage is compatible with Capture. loadImage() and updateImage() unnecessary, but pixels[] field exists. Began to write function for comparing color to target color
June 22nd: Learn to use get(x,y) function for color. Also, switched to HSV because it’s a much less complicated scheme for what I’m doing. Continued writing the color compare function
